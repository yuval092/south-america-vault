# Granada

The third largest city in the country. A colonial, sympathetic, and pleasant city. The city lies in the shadow of the spectacular Mombacho volcano and is in a very central location in Nicaragua, very close to a variety of sites and attractions like the Masaya volcano and national park, the white villages, lakes, and several volcanoes. A very colorful city, with small houses painted in a variety of colors, plenty of restaurants, cafes, markets, and food stalls. At night you can go on a bar crawl in the pedestrian street La Calzada, also known as Gringo Street, which is packed with lively and noisy pubs where you will hardly find locals, but mainly tourists from all over the world. The famous Laguna de Apoyo (20 minutes drive from the city) is a special lake located inside a volcano crater, turquoise water, monkeys roaming the area, breathtaking view.
