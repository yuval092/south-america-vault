# Salinas Grandes

The second largest salt flat in the world and located at the foot of the Sierras de Córdoba mountains.

**Overview:**
Serves as an alternative for those looking to visit a Salar and want to avoid entering Bolivia. The place is impressive and beautiful but the visit takes about two hours but does not compare in level to the Salt Flat in Bolivia.

**Arrival:**
It is advisable to arrive by rental car and when you reach the salt flat you will find paid guides there who will accompany you by motorcycle. You can arrive by bus from Jujuy to Purmamarca town and from there a taxi to the Salt Flat.
