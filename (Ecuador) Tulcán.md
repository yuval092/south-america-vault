# Tulcán

Small border town in the north serving as a crossing point to Colombia. In the quiet town, you won't find too many activities, but if you stop for rest:
* Wander the magnificent cemetery (Topiary Garden) known for sketched vegetation and special shapes.
* Peace Road tour.
* Day trip to Arrayanes Forest.
