# Jardín

A small, charming, and authentic town about an hour and a half from Medellín on the way to the coffee region. A colorful and calm town, not touristy, suitable for those looking to get off the beaten track. In the town, there is:
* An especially impressive church.
* Horseback riding tour to a cave with a waterfall and natural pool.
