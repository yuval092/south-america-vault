# Telica

The most recommended volcano trek in the country is to Telica, an active volcano 30 km from Leon. The crater is huge and located about 1000 meters above ground level, and the way to the summit is not particularly difficult. It is recommended to reach the summit at night to peek inside and see the lava glowing and bubbling.
