Small town to reach the Queulat Hanging Glacier (Ventisquero Colgante) located one hour south.
* Glacier open 08:00-17:00. Book in advance (choose Parque Nacional Queulat -> Sector Ventisquero).
* Enchanted Forest (Bosque Encantado): One of the most beautiful destinations on the Carretera Austral. Combination of forest, coral-like moss, and strange plants creating a fantasy movie look.
