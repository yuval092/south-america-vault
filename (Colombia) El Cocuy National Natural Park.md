# El Cocuy National Natural Park

A spectacular nature reserve in mountains over 5000 meters high and above the clouds. Indigenous people live in the park and access to sacred sites is closed, but you can do 3 tough day trips:
* El Pulpito del Diablo: A 23 km trek towards a snowy dome.
* Laguna Grande: A 22 km trek along strange palm trees and a spectacular lagoon.
* Ritacuba Trail: A 14 km trek reaching the glacier.
* You must register at the park offices before entry and must start the trek by 09:00 AM or you will not be allowed to leave for the trail.
* The national park is located east of San Gil and can be reached by car.
* Direct bus from Bogotá to the towns of El Cocuy (at 2750m) or Guicán (at 2890m). It is advisable to stop in El Cocuy for altitude acclimatization.
