# Ambergris Caye

A spectacular island with white beaches, tropical vegetation, and diving at the second-largest coral reef in the world. Most travelers choose to stay in the resort town of San Pedro. Recommendations include:
* Visiting the 'Secret Beach' (accessible by golf cart or taxi) and the Secret Beach Water Park.
* Snorkeling in the Hol Chan Marine Reserve with giant sea turtles, eels, and sharks.
* Visiting the ATM Caves—sacred underground Mayan caves where you can tour and swim (guided tours with flashlights, a unique experience).
* ATV tours in the jungle and along the beach.
* Renting a golf cart to travel along the island's shores.
* The island is accessible by ferry from Belize City, Caye Caulker, or Chetumal in Mexico.
