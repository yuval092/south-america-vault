# San Ignacio

A city near the Guatemala border, serving as a transit point and base for visiting nearby Mayan sites and the massive Caracol pyramid. Activities include:
* Visiting the Mountain Pine Ridge nature reserve, which includes rivers, pools, and waterfalls.
* Renting a canoe to sail on the river.
* Visiting an iguana rescue farm.
* Visiting a chocolate shop to learn about the chocolate-making process according to Mayan tradition.
* The most fascinating attraction is a visit to the ATM Cave—an especially large cave mostly filled with water, featuring spectacular stalactites and human skeletons. The tour is in a dark cave with a headlamp and helmet, with the entire route in water.
