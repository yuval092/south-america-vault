# Panama City

The capital city, a must-visit point when visiting the country.

**Central Places:**
* The famous Canal which is an engineering wonder (you will find an explanatory video dubbed by Morgan Freeman there)
* Walking along the promenade to the Old City (Casco Viejo) with colorful houses and the handicraft market in the central garden every Sunday (Mercado Nacional de Artesanías)
* Metropolitan Park which is a nature reserve with daily hiking trails
* Ancon Hill - a beautiful hill surrounded by green nature with a 30-minute climbing route revealing a beautiful view of the poor part of the city and the sea
* Cruise to Monkey Island (4-hour visit to an island with many monkeys of different types, iguanas, crocodiles and more)
* Multiplaza Pacific Mall and the huge Albrook Mall
* Kosher supermarkets 'Super Kosher' and 'Deli Market' (click for supermarket website)

**Unique Experience:**
* Visit Indian tribes, preferably in an organized tour - the Emberá tribe located about two hours south of the city, arrival by shuttle and canoe sailing in the river into the jungle and tour of the village. The locals dressed in local clothes will play music for you and you will receive a local lunch.
