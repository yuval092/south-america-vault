# Torotoro National Park

A stunningly beautiful national park located about 4 hours drive from Cochabamba (bus departs from Trans Aiquile). You must arrive by bus from the city to the park and purchase a tourist ticket (100 Bolivianos). Guides are available near the office, and you cannot go on trails without one. In the park, you will find:
* The Inca Trail.
* Dinosaur footprints.
* The largest stalactite cave in South America.
* A huge and especially impressive canyon.
* The village of Torotoro is simple, small, and very quiet. You can do daily treks with accommodation in the village or treks with camping in the park.
