# Puerto Vallarta

A resort and vacation city located on the coast of Bahia de Banderas offering spectacular beaches, whale watching, and the big attraction which is the Hidden Beach (Playa del Amor) created as a result of a giant bomb in a government experiment - the result is particularly spectacular. About an hour north of Vallarta you will find Sayulita which is a small paradise on the Pacific side.
