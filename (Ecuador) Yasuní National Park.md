# Yasuní National Park

Largest nature reserve in Ecuador located in the east below Cuyabeno. Part of the Amazon.
* Similar to Cuyabeno, allows animal viewing tours but is more expensive as you must go deeper.
* Cannot visit tribes (some may be dangerous to outsiders).
* Can sleep in tents (unlike Cuyabeno).
* Recommendation: Visit Cuyabeno; choose Yasuni only if seeking a survival experience.
