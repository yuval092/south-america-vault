# Calakmul

Xpujil is located an hour and a half west of Chetumal within the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve. In the reserve, you will find:
* An archaeological site with high pyramids deep in the jungle.
* The place is not touristy and the experience is different and special.
* You can take organized tours and even observe animals; with a lot of luck, you will see pumas.
