# Apoyo Lagoon

A spectacular lake formed inside an extinct volcano crater, making the water in the lake particularly clear and with a constant and pleasant temperature. A perfect destination for divers enjoying spectacular underwater sights and also for travelers coming to relax on a hammock with a breathtaking view of clear water in the shade of green tropical forests. A piece of paradise in Nicaragua. You can do SUP, tubing, and sailing to small islands in the lagoon.
