# Ometepe

A dreamy island composed of two volcanoes that rose inside Lake Nicaragua and fused together. This is an isolated and rare beauty island providing a tremendous experience for travelers enjoying fascinating trails in rare nature reserves with unique animals, wildlife, monkeys, giant butterflies, and plenty of special antiquity sites. The touristy town on the island is Moyogalpa and it is recommended to deepen into the island to the Maderas volcano area. Recommended to visit:
* Santo Domingo beach which has black volcanic soil.
* Jesus Maria viewpoint.
* Ojo de Agua - natural pools with volcanic soil in the middle of the jungle.
* Climb Maderas or Concepcion volcanoes.
* Visit an Israeli-owned chocolate factory and farm.
* Accessible by one-hour ferry from San Jorge town. (Fewer ferries on Sundays).
