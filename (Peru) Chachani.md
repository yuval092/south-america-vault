# Chachani

Considered the easiest trek in the world to a mountain at 6000m height, but don't be mistaken, it is a challenging trek due to high altitude.

**Trek Info:**
* Climbable all year round but in January-March you will meet rains occasionally
* Two-day trek
* First day ascent to Base camp at 5150m height
* Wake up very early in the morning and reach the summit and then return to the city
