# Leon

An hour and a half drive from Managua lies a cool small city considered a must-visit destination in Nicaragua due to its location near the country's famous chain of volcanoes, including Volcan Telica and Cerro Negro. The main attraction in the city is:
* Volcano boarding on Cerro Negro volcano, an adrenaline-filled extreme attraction.
* Telica Volcano trek.
* The White Cathedral of Leon (Catedral de Leon) - one of the largest and most beautiful in Central America; if you arrive on Sundays you will discover markets surrounding it.
