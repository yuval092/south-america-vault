# Caye Caulker

The most popular destination in the country for backpackers, due to the island's proximity to the second-largest coral reef in the world, and because it is cheaper, less touristy, and exceptionally beautiful compared to Ambergris Caye. Features include:
* Clear waters, white beaches, and the spectacular 'Great Blue Hole' diving site, making it a sought-after and must-visit destination in Belize.
* Options for diving courses and snorkeling.
* Visit 'The Split' (the main beach), Koko King (accessible by boat), and Iguana Reef (a hotel's secret beach with free entry).
* Arrival to the island is via ferry from San Pedro, Belize City, or Chetumal in Mexico.
