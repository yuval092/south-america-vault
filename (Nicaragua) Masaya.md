# Masaya

A lovely city offering a visit by car to the crater of the active Masaya Volcano and watching gushing lava - a breathtaking experience. The mountain is located 10 minutes drive from Masaya and 30 minutes from Granada. The mountain is located in a nature reserve with a Jurassic Park atmosphere; arrival to the crater by taxi. Recommended to arrive towards sunset so you can see the lava at its best.
