# Capurganá

A village located near the border with Panama, on a spectacular strip of beaches and jungles, coconut trees, clear water, and a very calm atmosphere. You can visit:
* La Coquerita natural pools.
* El Cielo nature reserve.
* Serves as a transit point for sailing to Panama (can be done via San Blas Islands - a must-visit).
