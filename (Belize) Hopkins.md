# Hopkins

A small village about 40 minutes by bus south of Dangriga. It offers:
* A beautiful beach with hammocks and seating areas.
* A visit to Anderson Lagoon to watch manatees and stingrays, and at night, glowing plankton.
* A visit to the Sitte River where you can find crocodiles and monkeys.
