# Bahía Solano

A town west of Medellín on the Pacific coast, accessible only by flight (with Satena). Here you will find a town devoid of tourists, black beaches, coconut trees, whale watching, and a lot of nature. Those afraid of insects should consider not coming as there are many.
* Whale watching between July and October inclusive.
* Snorkeling.
* Trip to natural pools.
* Sea turtle care.
