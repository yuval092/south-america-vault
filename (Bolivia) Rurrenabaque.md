# Rurrenabaque

An Amazon town in northern Bolivia with warm weather all year round. It serves as a departure point for:
* The Pampas (popular wetlands area).
* Madidi National Park, abundant in rainforests and stretching from the glacier-covered peaks of the Andes to the Tuichi River rainforests.
* In the Pampas (an organized reserve where you can see a wide variety of animals) and Madidi (a nature reserve offering survival or semi-survival experiences), you can go on princess tours, survival tours, see wild animals, and try fishing.
* Note: Arrive at this destination by flight and avoid traveling by van or car, as the drive is dangerous.
